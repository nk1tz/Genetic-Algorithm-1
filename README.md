This is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which uses a randomly generated population of strings to evolve the target string.

A Genetic or Evolutionary algorithms can be thought of as a search or optimization algorithm.
The basics components of a GA are:
1. A problem that needs solving.
2. A  way of measuring the quality of a potential solution to the problem.
3. A bunch of random potential solution.
4. A way of taking the best measured solutions to create a bunch of new ones.
5. A way making the process repeat until an acceptable or optimal, or perfect solution is found.

The hardest part of any Genetic Algorithm is the parameterization of the problem.
GA's lend themselves well to engineering optimization in situations where constraints are well defined and solution fitness easily measured.
